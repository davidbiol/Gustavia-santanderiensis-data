Description of results generated by the function kuenm_mmop


  A folder or folders named as the sets of variables analyzed contain all results of
  extrapolation risk analyses using the MOP metric.


  Inside each set-folder, raster files resulted from MOP analyses can be found. The names
  of the raster layers will help to identify the specific time period, emission scenario,
  and/or general circulation model accordingly.


  Values in raster files range from zero to one, where zero represents strict extrapolative
  areas, and other values represent levels of similarity between the calibration area and
  the specific scenario of projection. Suitability in areas of strict extrapolation
  (values of zero), should be interpreted carefully.


  Representing strict extrapolative areas separate from areas with distinct levels of
  similarity is recommended. However, if multiple GCMs where used, users may find convenient to
  use the kuenm_mopagree function, which creates raster layers of strict extrapolative area
  agreement among distinct GCMs.
